# Topic modeling on presidential speeches 

Here I try to understand what U.S. presidents spoke about during their tenure at the White House and how (in terms of sentiment analysis, readability...). 
It is all in R and uses a mix of technique from standard R and tidy R with numerous NPL packages. The topic extraction is an unsupervised LDA (I had to manually code the topics in natural language).
